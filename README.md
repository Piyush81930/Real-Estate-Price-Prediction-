# Real Estate Price Prediction

This project is a **Machine Learning model** designed to predict real estate property prices based on various influential factors, such as location, square footage, number of bedrooms, and other property characteristics.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to assist potential buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals in estimating property values more accurately. By leveraging a machine learning model trained on real estate data, the application provides a robust tool for forecasting property prices.

### Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and transformed raw data to handle missing values, outliers, and categorical variables.
- **Model Training**: Utilized algorithms like **Linear Regression, Decision Trees,** or **Random Forest** for better predictive accuracy.
- **Feature Engineering**: Included important features like location, property age, amenities, etc., to enhance model predictions.
- **Web Application**: Built using **Flask**, allowing users to enter property details and receive real-time price predictions.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Python** for programming
- **Flask** for the web framework
- **Scikit-Learn** for machine learning model building
- **Pandas** and **NumPy** for data handling
- **Pickle** for model saving and loading

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Flask app using `python app.py`.
4. Access the web interface and input property details to get price predictions.

## Future Improvements
- Expand to include more geographic regions.
- Improve model accuracy with advanced techniques like ensemble learning.
- Add a user-friendly front-end interface.
